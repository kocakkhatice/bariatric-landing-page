          We're the Original and the Best! For years, Bariatric Eating has been
          formulating lip smacking flavors for your post op palate. Our products
          are GMP quality that meet or surpass supplement guidelines of the
          ASMBS and top bariatric centres. We don’t repurpose cheap body builder
          protein and 1990's diet doctor food and tell you it's special. We
          develop our own products - that's why we are number one.
